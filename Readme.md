# 🍎 Fruit Detection using YOLOv5

This project was developed using the YOLOv5 architecture to automatically detect different types of fruits. The dataset was labeled using Roboflow, and the model was trained in Google Colab. After the training process, the model achieved successful accuracy rates on test images and provided effective results in fruit detection. The repo contains Python code supporting the training and testing processes.
